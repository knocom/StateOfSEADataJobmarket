It relies on the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA or KLHS), a methodological framework that pursues a change of paradigm away from an old unsustainable model of utilization of natural resources and of reliance on high carbon emission sources of energy; and into a new sustainable model that preserves the country??s vast natural capital base, while shifting towards renewable, low carbon sources of energy. The LCDI policies now has been incorporated in the National Medium Term Development Plan, so called RPJMN 2020-2024. The analytical work of LCDI has offered insights not only on the actions for moving into a path of low carbon development, but also on the expected co-benefits derived from climate action. Results of the analysis show unequivocal gains in terms of value addition, employment, and welfare indicators, associated with a transition to low carbon systems and a growth model that preserves the country??s natural capital, including forests, biodiversity and water resources.
