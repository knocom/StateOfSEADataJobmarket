Manila HealthTek, Inc. (MTek, Inc.) is the first of its kind in the Philippines. It is principally a private Research and Development company with a robust diagnostic technology pipeline. As a first ever university spin-off from the University of the Philippines, it will develop and manufacture portable diagnostic kits for the diagnosis of selected infectious diseases in the Philippines and in the region.
