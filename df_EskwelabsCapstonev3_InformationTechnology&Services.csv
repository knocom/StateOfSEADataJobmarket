Fitch Group is comprised of: Fitch Ratings, a global leader in credit ratings and research; Fitch Solutions, a leading provider of credit market data, analytical tools and risk services; and Fitch Learning, a preeminent training and professional development firm. With dual headquarters in London and New York, Fitch Group is owned by Hearst. Fitch Ratings is a leading provider of credit ratings, commentary and research. Dedicated to providing value beyond the rating through independent and prospective credit opinions, Fitch Ratings offers global perspectives shaped by strong local market experience and credit market expertise. The additional context, perspective and insights we provide help investors to make important credit judgments with confidence. As a global credit rating agency, Fitch Ratings gauges the ability of entities and instruments to meet their credit obligations. Investors and financial market participants rely on multiple sources, and the credit rating ?? indicating how an issue or transaction is likely to perform over time ?? is one of their key inputs. In this way, we help investors map potential credit risks. Fitch Solutions, a subsidiary of Fitch Ratings, provides a range of industry-leading products and professional development services to the global financial community. In addition to offering proprietary market-based content, it distributes the ratings, research and financial data of Fitch Ratings through a variety of flexible platforms. With innovation and experience behind every solution it brings to market, our offerings are designed to meet the diverse needs of the fixed-income markets. Fitch complies with all laws governing employment in each jurisdiction in which it operates, and provides equal opportunity to all applicants and employees. All applications will be considered without regard to race, colour, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability, marital or veteran status, sexual orientation, and other status protected by applicable laws. Department Overview: The Fitch Ratings Financial Institutions Group has actively built the agency into the global leader in bank credit rating coverage. The Group is also experiencing growing coverage of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), including asset managers, securities firms, leasing/factoring companies and captives. Our experienced analysts provide comprehensive, timely and transparent coverage of every major institution around the world, as well as unparalleled coverage of smaller companies. Our analysts offer a diversity of talent and backgrounds, with experience in regulatory oversight, investment banking, buy-side investing, accounting and more. The FI group's rating process utilises a set of rating scales that are unique to Fitch Ratings. The Viability Rating, which expresses Fitch Ratings' view of a bank's stand-alone financial profile, is combined with the Support Rating to arrive at the Issuer Default Rating, an anchor for its debt issue ratings. Fitch Ratings' Support Rating and Support Rating Floors provide important insight relative to the likelihood and nature of external support should the financial institution experience financial difficulties. Ratings guidelines are applied to long and short-term foreign currency ratings; long and short-term local currency ratings; and National ratings for emerging markets (non-comparable across borders). Quantitative aspects of a financial institution's strengths and weaknesses are reviewed, such as balance sheet integrity, profitability, cash flow generating ability and risk management. The analysts also evaluate qualitative factors of the institution, such as strategy and quality of management, the environment in which it operates, and the most likely future development of its business. Final rating determinations are made by committees comprised of lead analysts and seasoned independent committee members, including Fitch Ratings senior management. PT Fitch Ratings Indonesia was established in 2005 and Fitch is the only international rating agency with a local presence in Indonesia.

Proficio invented the concept of SOC-as-a-Service. We were the first MSSP to provide automated response services and the first in our space to provide a risk scoring dashboard.  Our typical client is a medium to large-sized organization that lacks the in-house resources to address the challenges of a rapidly changing threat landscape. The difficulty of hiring and retaining cybersecurity professionals are widely understood but our prospective clients also struggle to effectively harness technology and build hardened processes.  While Proficio has developed a unified service delivery platform designed to meet the needs of the most demanding clients, what sets us apart is the quality and passion of our people.

Working at Thinking Machines
Thinking Machines is a data science startup. Our vision is for the Philippines to become a global hub for data science. To do that, we create data science cultures, one organization at a time. We??re a company made up of intellectually curious, civic-minded, forever-learning individuals. We believe that great data science products are built with care for people and that the best way to drive inclusive innovation is to start with a diverse team.
Our field of work is incredibly dynamic, so we want to work with people who are committed to growing with us. We want to hire people who can demonstrate an ability to learn, then provide them with personalized coaching, growth opportunities, and a great working environment to bring their skills to the next level and develop world-class talent.
Role Description
As a technology consultancy dealing with large amounts of data day-to-day, we recognize the importance of following data protection regulations set by local and international governing bodies. As the Data Protection Officer, it is your duty to analyze, monitor, and ensure all data processing activities of Thinking Machines are compliant to data privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation and the Data Privacy Act. This covers both our client projects and internal efforts, as well as our engagements with vendors and partners. You will be working closely with our Senior Leadership Team, as well as our Engineering team to fulfill this mandate.
From a process standpoint, this entails conducting control activities including, but not limited to, designing policies on data collection, access and processing, and conducting data access reviews, privacy impact assessments and Personally Identifying Information reviews, while ensuring these processes are both compliant and relevant to TM??s fast-paced, dynamic technology environment. From a legal standpoint, you will also be responsible for maintaining our legal compliance strategy and materials, such as securing local government permits with the SEC, and administering Data Sharing Agreements and Non-Disclosure Agreements.
You need to ensure our accreditation or certification, and renewal thereof, from relevant data privacy governing bodies to maintain proper regulatory standards. This includes becoming the officially appointed Data Protection Officer of Thinking Machines for the Philippines?? National Privacy Commission, and its equivalents.
In the event of security incidents, you will facilitate proper data breach and security incident management, and submit compliance documentation to the relevant governing bodies within the prescribed time frame.
Lastly, data security does not start and end with you; the whole organization has a crucial role in upholding our compliance standards. As such, you will be tasked to cultivate awareness within the company, advising employees on the data protection rules and regulations enforced by the relevant governing bodies, and write clear reports translating regulations into practical tactics.
As we continually expand the reach of Thinking Machines, this position is perfect for individuals interested in growing their legal expertise in international technology and data laws. We recognize that this is a new and growing field of practice. Would like to hire a driven, tenacious, dedicated learner who the company will invest in by providing training (both legal and technical) and opportunities to grow.
Requirements
We are looking for someone who has the following traits:
Knowledge of relevant privacy or data protection policies and practices
Experience in data management, data governance design and implementation
Excellent communication skills (written and verbal) to communicate concerns, issues, and solutions with both internal and external stakeholders
Project management skills to drive data governance related initiatives
Willingness and ability to learn the company??s technology stack, particularly cloud technologies
3-7 years of relevant previous experience 
Additionally, we are requiring candidates to have an internet connection speed of at least 12mbps and a viable work from home setup, as we are now operating as a fully remote company.
